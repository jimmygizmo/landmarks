# landmarks
Starting with developer.apple.com Landmarks SwiftUI tutorial app, let's see if we can evolve it and perfect good techniques for IOS apps in 2021. This will be hand coded as this and related tutorials are followed. The result will not be code just copied from the tutorial downloads. Some resources like images might be used unmodified or sharable content may be substituted. I will potentiall add a lot of well-organized and easy-to-read comments and documentation within any code file where it may be helpful, illustrative and relevant. This is both for myself and people learning from my efforts. I will of course add information coming from my own experience and perhaps related to backend systems for apps in general, built with technologies like Python, Docker, GCP and AWS, etc.. Things could go in any direction and there will always be some of the best info in code comments and quickly-composed text-file documentation I will add as it seems beneficial or the information is particularly relevant at that phase of development. I will regularly clean up comments and rough documentation and distill it down into more concise, readable and valuable information in a more formal documentaion format as things proceed. This will at times include error and/or log output, because those details and the mistakes you make are in fact the most important lessons you learn from as you continuously become a better developer.
